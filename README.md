# Mandelfash UI

## Description

This project was made as a simple way to test the [Mandelfash Generator](https://github.com/HerrTuring/mandelfash-generator) and make it easier to see it working in real time.

It requires that you download and compile the other project first.

This was originally coded by demand for Dave Fashenpour on 2018 as another test and work-in-progress to his idea of an easy-to-use DLL to calculate the mandelfash slices with multi-threading (implemented in another project later).

## Usage

First download [Mandelfash Generator](https://github.com/HerrTuring/mandelfash-generator) and compile it, you will need the .exe file.

After just open this project in Visual Studio 2022 and compile. After compiling take the generated .exe file from the previous step and drop it inside the same folder as this project's .exe and then you can run.
